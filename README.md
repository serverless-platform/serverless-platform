This Repository is the Main Documentation Source of the serverless-platform Project
You can find Informations about the Concepts and Highlevel Ideas in the [@direktspeed/serverless-platform](https://github.com/direktspeed/serverless-platform) Repository.

## Cluster Platform
Its also considered to call this The Cluster Platform as it is able to Put anything into a Cluster Software Stack.
The Main Component of the Serverless Platform is indeed the @direktspeed/cluster Module that defines the Software used inside your DIREKTSPEED Powered Cluster or Clusters. A Cluster is simply a conglomerat. Cluster a Conglomerat of Software defined by Protocols.

Cluster Managers are docker or other executors ex: kubernetes, serverless framework anything can be a Orchestrator for your cluster in the smallest case its only your application.

## Conglomerat
As nouns the difference between cluster and conglomerate is that cluster is a group or bunch of several analog and discrete items that are more or less close to each other while conglomerate is a cluster of heterogeneous things.
As verbs the difference between cluster and conglomerate is that cluster is to form a cluster or group while conglomerate is to combine together into a larger mass. A Conglomerat can be seen in the Software world as a Stack, Collection, Suite all this terms are Highlevel Abstractions of the Software Conglomerat one of the Biggest Software Conglomerates is Open Source as this bundels many hetrogenios Software Projects under one Umbrella!

As a adjective conglomerate is clustered together into a mass.

## Cluster Conglomerates
Serverless Platform allows you to Cluster a Software Conglomerate into something selfhealing autoscaling less administration effort needed to help you focus on the Core Components of your Software or lets say End User Applications. it does that via Interconnectivity Features.

## Interconnectivity
Interconnectivity is the Key of The Serverless Platform it allows you to abstract away any heterogeneity via addition of a Interconnectivity Layer that makes out of your Software Stack (Conglomerate) a Cluster so to make Sense. Interconnectivity of Conglomerate Hetrogenios Software forms a Cluster! 


## What makes DIREKTSPEED Serverless Platform Outstanding and Unique?
a good example is the Guide from https://serverless-stack.com/ it describes how to use AWS to build a Serverless Software Stack in a Opinionated way via Amazon AWS and React while DIREKTSPEED Serverless Platform is a Guide with Real World Examples to build Something like AWS Yourself so it brings back the Power to You the Owner of a Product with no Third Party Envolved!

It’s a fully automated Platform Development Toolkit To build a System that lives at home or the office and allows you to take control of your digital life. Why pay monthly for storage services like iCloud, Dropbox, or Google Drive when you can own one? Why pay annually to host your website on someone else’s server when you could easily host it yourself? When you use The Software and Concepts from DIREKTSPEED Serverless Platform you own your stuff and maintain total privacy and control. You don't need To Pay for Services that Lock you into Something that you don't own or Control again Interconnectivity Still allows you to even use That Services for example to Prototype faster while you RollOut your own Products and Services.

## The Problem
Today all over the Internet people are giving away their digital rights. When you sign up for things like iCloud, Gmail, Google Drive, Dropbox, Facebook, or a hundred others, you get access to convenient services like online storage, email, and connections with friends and family. But you also make trade-offs. For what you gain in convenience you lose in ownership, security, privacy, and control. You give away things like ownership of your photos and grant advertisers access to see your personal information. You also make yourself more vulnerable to hacks by using centralized services because they make big juicy targets for criminals. What if there was another way?

## The Solution
What if you could keep all the things you love about any Cloud Provider like Microsoft, Google, IBM, Apple or Services like iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, GoDaddy, Spotify, and Facebook, but lose the baggage? What if you could ditch the advertisers and eleminate the need for any Third Party? With Software coded and Hosted by Your Self with help of the DIREKTSPEED Serverless Platform , you can. Now you can take control of your data and keep it secure and private. You own the hardware and software. You own it all. With With the DIREKTSPEED Serverless Platform Concepts and Tools you no longer have to make a choice between convenience, security, and ownership. You can have it all. You can take control of your digital life and Company!
