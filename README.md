You can find Informations about the Concepts and Highlevel Ideas in the [@direktspeed/serverless-platform](https://github.com/direktspeed/serverless-platform) Repository.

## Cluster Platform
Its also considered to call this The Cluster Platform as it is able to Put anything into a Cluster Software Stack.
The Main Component of the Serverless Platform is indeed the @direktspeed/cluster Module that defines the Software used inside your DIREKTSPEED Powered Cluster or Clusters. A Cluster is simply a conglomerat. Cluster a Conglomerat of Software defined by Protocols.

## Conglomerat
As nouns the difference between cluster and conglomerate is that cluster is a group or bunch of several analog and discrete items that are more or less close to each other while conglomerate is a cluster of heterogeneous things.
As verbs the difference between cluster and conglomerate is that cluster is to form a cluster or group while conglomerate is to combine together into a larger mass. A Conglomerat can be seen in the Software world as a Stack, Collection, Suite all this terms are Highlevel Abstractions of the Software Conglomerat one of the Biggest Software Conglomerates is Open Source as this bundels many hetrogenios Software Projects under one Umbrella!

As a adjective conglomerate is clustered together into a mass.

## Cluster Conglomerates
Serverless Platform allows you to Cluster a Software Conglomerate into something selfhealing autoscaling less administration effort needed to help you focus on the Core Components of your Software or lets say End User Applications. it does that via Interconnectivity Features.

## Interconnectivity
Interconnectivity is the Key of The Serverless Platform it allows you to abstract away any heterogeneity via addition of a Interconnectivity Layer that makes out of your Software Stack (Conglomerate) a Cluster so to make Sense. Interconnectivity of Conglomerate Hetrogenios Software forms a Cluster! a
